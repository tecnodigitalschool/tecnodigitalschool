# About me

Hi, my name is Miguel Herraez!

I founded **TecnoDigital School** a few years back (2021) to help other engineers and scientists in the field of Numerical Simulation, in particular **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**.

My focus for problem solving is to combine the power of FE software (e.g. Abaqus) with the infinite versatility of programming (e.g. Python).

At [TecnoDigital School](tecnodigitalschool.com) you can check out all the contents that I've created:
- From the Blog, addressing different fundamental concepts and some unknown capabilities of Python inside Abaqus.
- Up to the extensive courses devoted to subjects like simulation of composite materials, Python scripting in Abaqus and user subroutines in Abaqus, among others.

Every now and then I organize free online seminars on different simulation topics. If you want to be notified about them, subscribe [here](https://tecnodigitalschool.com/gift/).

If you have any question, don't hesitate to reach me out at [contact@tecnodigitalschool.com](contact@tecnodigitalschool.com).

See you there!
